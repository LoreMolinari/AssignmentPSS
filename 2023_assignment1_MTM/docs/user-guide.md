## 1. Introduction

### Project Overview
Welcome to the documentation for the Software Development Process project. This project is the result of coursework undertaken at the University of Milano-Bicocca. It revolves around a straightforward application that connects a front-end application to a database, primarily to keep track of user logins.

### Purpose
The primary goal of this documentation is to guide users through the project, explain its functionality, and provide insights into the implementation of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) techniques.

## 2. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A working environment for Python.
- Knowledge of the Python programming language.
- Access to a MySQL database.

### Installation
- pip install user-MTM

## 3. Using the Application

### Logging In
Once the project is set up, you can use it to log in users. The project includes functionality to track user logins.

### Monitoring User Logins
You can monitor user logins by using the methods provided by the project. To retrieve login counts, refer to the `get_count` method. To increment the login count, use the `increment` method. Details about these methods are explained in the next section.

## 4. Useful Resources

For more information on MySQL and Python integration, you can refer to the [MySQL Connector/Python Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/).

This user guide provides an overview of the Software Development Process project and its key functionalities, making it easier for you to work with the project effectively. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the project's documentation for further assistance.
