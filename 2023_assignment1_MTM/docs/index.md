# Documentation for the MTM Group first assignment

Welcome to the documentation for the Software Development Process project developed as part of the coursework at the University of Milano-Bicocca. This project focuses on a simple application that connects a front-end application to a database in order to keep track of user logins.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a comprehensive CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline, highlighting the various tools and processes involved.

## Our Methods

We have implemented the following methods in our project:

1. `increment(self)`: This method is responsible for incrementing the login counter in the database when a user logs-in.

2. `get_count(self)`: This method retrieves the login counter and allows you to display the number of user logins.
